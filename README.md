# Gemini-Clone

## Overview
The Gemini Clone project is an interactive application designed to mimic the core functionality of the Gemini protocol. Gemini is a lightweight, text-based internet protocol focused on privacy, simplicity, and content. This clone replicates a similar environment, allowing users to engage with minimalistic prompts and input-driven content navigation.

## Features
- **Prompt-Driven Interaction:** Users interact with the system through prompts, making input-based decisions that determine the flow of the content.
- **Minimalistic UI:** Following the philosophy of the Gemini protocol, the interface emphasizes simplicity and clarity, stripping away unnecessary design elements to focus solely on content.
- **Privacy-Centric:** Data exchange is kept minimal, aligning with Geminiâ€™s focus on providing a more privacy-conscious alternative to the modern web.
- **Content Rendering:** It supports text rendering similar to how content is delivered on Gemini browsers, maintaining the integrity of the information without overwhelming distractions.
- **Lightweight Framework** Built using JavaScript and React, the app ensures a fast, responsive, and low-resource-usage experience for users.
